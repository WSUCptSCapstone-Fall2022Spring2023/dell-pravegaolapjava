421 presentation powerpoint due this Friday -> create shared powerpoint
Bo talking about kafka discovery
Kakfa supervisor spec -> similar to our architecture we specified! This creates the kafka supervisor
“Create index task” this is inside the supervisor spec. This task starts running in “incremental publishing kafka index task runner” -> each index task will have one runner? 
Return new incremental…runner() an instance
Seekable stream index task runner: provided by druid. We should have our runner inherit from this class
Investigate test cases! There will be some stuff for ingestion 
Nate: ask derek about his friend from imply to ask questions in druid
Bo: ask druid channel for the location of the ingestion of streams into deep storage from kafka to druid
Seekablestreamsupervisor -> lots of classes inherit from this
Bo: supervisor, can we show the diagram for class? -> nate says the show diagram doesn’t really work for really complex code
