Prototype
Currently done: Reading from Pravega and then write to druid
First connect to the tcp port in Pravega (reading complete) 
We read an instance by listening to a port (build the standalone first) 
We haven’t have anything to deploy, no CI/CD yet so we’ve tested by printing stuff out 
Processing and indexing would be next (for druid) using that Pravega info 
Dell mentor recommendations: 
They recommended the schema registry 
They recommended copy and pasting the kafka plugin
Future work 
Multiple segments (multiple readers) 
Indexing and druid & schema registry 
Command line interface 
We need to be more aggressive in the way we ask the mentors the questions
