Seccond Client meeting: 
Objective: Address questions from our slack channel and to go over our rough draft of our project description assignment

- Each team member spoke of their sections and received feedback from the Dell engineers: 

- Introduction: 
  - Emphasize less about the events stored in Pravega's data streams, and talk more about how Pravega is column oriented
  - We want to enable big data anlytics queries to be made against the events in pravega. To do this, a processing engine is required -> OLAP
    - But OLAPs are row oriented. Talk about this in the intro! 
    
- Background: 
  - Nothing major here, the content here was liked by the Dell engineers
  
- Project Overview: 
  -	Talk about deliverables, what exactly are we delivering 
    -	This is a plugin for (Pravega or druid?)
    -	Why do we need this plugin
    -	How do we deliver it (dev for a year, agile, testing, use cases) 
      -	We’ll do this 1st, then 2nd, we are highlighting the proj plan, timeline 
  -	How do we deploy it
  -	How will we write it (java)
  -	What is the end goal

- Stakeholders
  - Pretty straightforward. Who is involved in the project/has stake in Pravega's data streams
  
- Objective Milestones
  -	Final outcome: ingestion plugin is merged with the apache druid or pino source coude – Derek
    -	Being able to read from Pravega
  -	Milestones
    -	Testing - We can use debezium as a way to demo our proj, but it isn't necessary to mention it in our context/background
    -	“I have this data and I know it’s structure, and I have a source (OLAP) and I wanna merge them together”
