9/26/2022 scrum notes: 
- Email AJ regarding our DELL client meeting schedule and the assignments always being due before we get to meet with client. As well as asking about what to push to our github
- Requirements and specifications assignment due 9/27
  - Read over the sections and came up with questions to ask the DELL engineers
  - Will ask in the Dell slack channel about the definitive list of features/functionalities to begin writing up this assignment (will ask more questions depending on their response)
