Discussed sprint2
Need to update readME, create sprint report, and demo video
Add github issues
We want to present the read and write code in the video to show that technical progress is beginning 
Plans: connect to and read from Pravega
In Pravega client api, we see how we can connect to Pravega standalone and create a streamReader. 
For local testing we can use Pravega standalone to write some random data, then read it, then transform that data to be written into druid 
About this approach thoughâ€¦ we need to know how to write into druid. Is there an existing pipeline that writes into druid so we can see how they format their data before writing?
