# Sprint x Report (8/26/21 - 9/24/2021) 

  

## What's New (User Facing) 

There are currently no new user facing features after sprint 1. 

  

## Work Summary (Developer Facing) 

Although we didn’t have user-facing in the current sprint, we have gained substantial knowledge about stream processing, Pravega, Apache Druid, and Apache Kafka. We have been reading APIs and documentation to understand the requirements of the project. When concepts aren't as straightforward, we seek clarification either from the client or fellow team members.   

## Unfinished Work 

All user stories in Sprint 1 are completed. Since there are many client APIs from Pravega and Apache Druid need to learn before starting with any code, we expect to have some code for Sprint 2. 

**Progress of Sprint 1** 
- [x] Team Inventory Docs 
- [x] Project Description Docs 
- [x] Requirement and Specification Docs 
- [x] Solution Approach Docs

## Retrospective Summary 

Here's what went well: 

Creating a separate discord server for team communication allowed us to organize our communication via different channels. It also allowed us to join voice calls in order to hold meetings. Without this separate server, the team’s communication would be less coordinated and cohesive, hindering our collaboration.  

Setting up weekly scrum meetings was very beneficial for the team. The first few weeks we did not have these meetings set up and the team felt really isolated. We would send messages in our server occasionally saying what we were doing, but it was not too interactive. Once weekly meetings were scheduled, the whole team could announce what they worked on, what their future work looks like, as well as discuss any issues relating to current or upcoming assignments. We aim to increase the occurrences of our scrum meetings as the work begins to get more complex and as we begin diving into the repositories containing relevant code. With these scrum meetings we were able to communicate and coordinate our research/work in order to familiarize ourself with the problem space and technologies involved in this project. With this, we would divide up sections for our assignments according to the research someone had done already. This allowed each person to write the sections they knew the most.  

Another thing that went well was requesting for a one-hour meeting with our Dell clients. Usually, we meet for 30 minutes once every week. Weekly meetings are what works best for our client, but only meeting for 30 minutes really limited the things we could discuss in each meeting. By requesting and setting up a one hour meeting we were able to get lots of things explained/hashed out with our clients and the whole team came out of that meeting feeling good about the amount of information shared by the clients.  

  

Here's what we'd like to improve: 

We would like to improve our current assignment schedule. Currently we meet our clients every Thursday and most assignments are due on Wednesdays. Because of this, we end up submitting most assignments late, on Friday’s. The team would prefer having a less strict assignment schedule so we as a team must work together in order to get ahead and improve our current working schedule for written assignments.  

We as a team want to improve our communication via Slack. Dell engineers created a Pravega Slack channel specifically for our team so that we are able to ask questions to our clients without having to wait for our Thursday meetings. Currently we ask questions occasionally, but we are not fully taking advantage of this direct communication channel with Dell. We want to ask more questions via the Slack and not ask everything all at once during our short 30-minute weekly meetings.  

 

Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint: 

In sprint 2 we plan to complete the Testing and Acceptance Plans section. This section will require us to meet with our client and ask questions through the Slack channel in order to gain clear requirements on what the testing should look like.  

Within the next sprint we plan to be familiar with the Druid and Pravega APIs that will be used within our project to read from Pravega and write to Druid. To do this we will need to review the Apache Kafka and possibly the Apache Kinesis repositories since these repos also implement a plugin that utilizes APIs that we’ll likely need to use. Reviewing and asking questions about these repos will allow the team to become familiar with the code base and APIs. Relating to code, we also plan to get started with a Dell repository where we will be writing our code in. Dell engineers stated that they have a repository set up for us that we’ll likely fork into our WSU capstone repo.
